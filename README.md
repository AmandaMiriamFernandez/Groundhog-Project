Groundhog Predictions
This project explores famous Groundhog Day predictors and how accurate are they? Groundhog Day is often treated as lighthearted tradition, but each year a prediction is made about the arrival of spring. For this project, I gathered historical predictions from well-known groundhogs and compared them to what actually happened that year.
